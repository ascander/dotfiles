# Ascander's Dotfiles without Nix

If you're looking for the Nix-based system configuration, you want [ascander/dots](https://github.com/ascander/dots)

## Overview

This is a Nix-free version of my personal development environment for macOS machines. This includes:

- Neovim, with a Lua-based config, and using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugin management
- Homebrew for applications, packages, fonts, etc.
- Configuration for the tools I use (symlinked by [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)) including:
    - Alacritty
    - Tmux
    - Karabiner Elements
    - ZSH
